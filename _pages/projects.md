As I am interested in data science and machine learning, much of my time is spent on creating side projects or re-implementing papers. Below you will find my recent projects that I did during my free time outside classes or on vacations which I am very proud of. ðŸ˜†


# LeNet-5 From Scratch

<div class='widgets'>
  <a href="https://github.com/T0mLam/LeNet-5-from-scratch"><i class="fab fa-github github-button"></i></a>
</div>

During the summer vacation after my foundation year, I took an [online course](https://tinyurl.com/bdr6href) on machine learning which really sparked my interest in deep neural networks. ðŸ¤© Having nothing else to do as I was living in Bristol, I decided to spend my summer building a handwritten digit recognition app, marking the start of my journey in deep learning. ðŸ¥³
