It is about everything interesting and challenging during the process of building my [LeNet-5 From Scratch](https://t0mlam.github.io/projects/) project. Please lower your expectation before clicking in. 😬🫣

# How I got started in machine learning

My interest in ML emerged during my computer science foundation year. At the time, one of my assignment for the English for Academic Purpose module was to write an essay about an ethical issue in the field of computer science that everyone should know.

The topic I wrote about was related to the ethics of recommender systems, which powers the search engines of websites like Youtube and Netflix. Despite the fact that I did not have any technical understanding of how recommender systems work, I was deeply intrigued by the ethical issues I had researched into, e.g. cold-start problem, the diversity problem and etc. I was curious and keen to know the working principles and the ML algorithms behind this 'black-box' seeing how powerful and influential recommender systems were to every internet users.

Fastforward to 14/6/2024, I was relieved as I finished all my IFP examination. I planned to spend my summer on an ML online course on Coursera. During the process, I learned a lot about the foundation of machine learning, from linear algebra to the linear regression model and the gradient descent optimizer for neural networks, as well as machine learning tools like scikit-learn and PyTorch. 

As I have finished the course in late July, I decided to put together my knowledge and challenge myself with a project. The challenge I gave myself was to implement the LeNet-5 model from scratch.
