Read this article if you are a prospective Warwick IFP student who wants to know how to get accepted to Imperial or UCL CS. ðŸ˜³ #ValuableInsights #DefinitelyNotClickbeit

# Sorry but you might be disappointed 

The reality hurts.

In Warwick IFP '24, only 2 students are accepted to UCL CS and 0 accepted to Imperial computing in ~50 CS students. And I believe nobody got the interview from Imperial.

# Be optimistic, you could be the top 5% student in the IFP after reading this blog ðŸ˜¹

Just kidding. Having top grades at the Warwick IFP will not guarantee you a place in these 2 universities. Grades are just prerequisites before they consider your admission test scores, awards and projects. However, it would certainly help you get a conditional offer from Manchester, King's and etc.

If you would want to know how I study in the IFP and my advices for the future IFP CS students, please continue reading. ðŸ˜Š

# Who am I ?

I am Tom, a Warwick IFP alumnus graduated in the summer of 2024. ðŸ¥³ I came to Warwick after finishing Form 5, equivalent to year 11, in the Hong Kong DSE curriculum. During my time in the IFP, I was studying the computer science pathway so I took the path maths, further maths, computer science and the inquiry and research skills for maths modules. As I have graduated from the IFP, I am going to embark on a journey to the University of Bristol to start my undergraduate study in computer science. 

# My motivation on writing this blog

__I really want to help all the IFP CS students to achieve the best outcomes they can possibly achieve and get in their dream universities.__

Before the start of the IFP, there were things I wished I knew but I didn't, e.g. what topics are we going to learn, what resources can we use for revision and most importantly what grades do I need make the progression to a CS degree. 

That's why I decided to write this blog to share everything I know to you. Although the curriculum of the IFP and the entry requirements for a CS degree could be slight changed in the future, I believe my advices would still be very useful and I would strongly recommend you read to the end of this blog post.

# Disclaimer: things that I do not know

- __STEP exams__: I got rejected from Imperial before they gave me any STEP offers so I did not take the exam or prepared for it. However, the reason I did not revise for the exam is that I had always thought STEP exams were optional but it was not. I would advice you to start revising during the summer before the IFP starts or during the first term before the winter break as the workload will increase drastically in the second and final term.

- __TMUA exams__: TMUA was not a requirement for Warwick BSc computer science in my year so I did not take the exam. Same as the STEP exams, I would suggest to start revising during the summer or the first term. It is sad to see Warwick's entry requirements and the IFP tests difficulty go up every year but that is what's happening very unfortunitely.

# Set your goals

Here are some of the conditional offers received in 2024 from me and my classmates. 

| Programme | Requirements |
| --------------- | --------------- | 
| Warwick Computer Science | Overall 75%, Pure Maths 85%, Further Maths 85%|
| Warwick Computer System Engineering | Overall 70%, 70% in all modules |
| UCL Computer Science | Row 3, Column 2 | 
| Manchester Computer Science | Row 3, Column 2 | 
| KCL Computer Science | Row 3, Column 2 | 
| Bristol Computer Science | Overall 70%, 70% in all modules |
| Cardiff Computer Science | Overall 65%, 60% in Pure Maths & Further Maths | 

I also had a list of entry requirements that I got from the IFP University Fair in 27/10/2023,
but I did not know if anyone actually got the offers with those specific grades.

| Programme | Requirements |
| --------------- | --------------- | 
| QMUL Computer Science | Overall 70% |
| Southampton Computer Science | Overall 75%, 75% in Pure Maths & Further Maths |
| Birmingham Computer Science | Overall 70% | 
| Leicester Computer Science | Overall 65% | 
| Durham Computer Science | Overall 70% | 
| Aston Computer Science | Overall 65%, 60% in Pure Maths & Further Maths |

The advice for UCAS I would give is to apply for either Imperial or UCL, you won't lose anything for trying ðŸ™‚, but do not expect to get a conditional offer. Apply for Warwick of course as you will get a guarantee offer. From my experience in 23/24, King's and Manchester tend to give offers to most student with a high predicted grade so you could apply if you are interested in those 2 universities. At the end, choose 1 or 2 universities from the 70% range for your insurance choice. You could also put a university with 65% overall as your insurance as they will most likely give you an offer. 

But at the end of the days, I believe choosing Warwick is your best bet. As far as I know, Warwick has one of the largest computer science society and data science society out of all UK universities behind Imperial and UCL so I am sure you are going to have a good time there if you enjoy socializing.

If your target is Warwick computer system engineering, you will only need to score 70% in the IFP which is not difficult to achieve. However, if you want to progress to Warwick computer science, you will need at least 85% in both math modules and 75% overall which is quite challenging to be honest.

# How to achieve it ? 

If you are aiming for Warwick computer science:

- __Pure Maths__: Aim for 90% in the 2 class tests, 85% in the final exam
- __Further Maths__: Aim for 90% in the 2 class tests, 85% in the final exam
- __Computer Science__:  Aim for > 70%
- __IRS for Maths__: Do your best ðŸ¤£, at least get a 70% overall

Although getting 90% in the maths class tests may seems a little out of reach, but I promised you it was possible as long as you have the resources and are willing to spend time revising. Here is my IFP transcript.

Remember the Warwick IFP qualification is equivalent to the GCE A-level, so you can expect the curriculum and exam question types to be very similar. I have used some a level past papers for revision and I found them to be helpful so I will share those with you below.

## Pure Maths

The assessments I had for the modules were 2 class tests (each accounts for 25% of the final grade) and a final exam (accounts for 50%). 

I recommend aiming for higher scores in class tests because the questions are typically shorter, easier, and more focused, unlike final exams, where each question can cover a mix of topics. It also takes pressure off you and enables you to spend more time revising for STEP or other the admission tests in the final term.

### Topics to be covered
Polynomials, partial fraction & binomial expansion, sequence & series, exponential & logorithms, trigonometry, conic sections, coordinate geometry, differentiation & integration, complex numbers, mathematical logic, method of proof, set, function


### How to revise

For each pure maths topic, there will be a lecture note you get from lecture and a seminar problems sheet. It is very likely you would not have sufficient time to finish the worksheet during seminars, but make sure to finish them after classes as those are great study materials. Also make sure to attend the formative class tests, exams and finish all the revision worksheets.

Additionally, you can search for a levels maths past papers from `physicsandmathstutor.com`. You can find all questions by topics by clicking into any exam boards.
