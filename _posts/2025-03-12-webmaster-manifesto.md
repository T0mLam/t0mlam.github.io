# Manifesto

Hi there, I‚Äôm Tom, a first-year CS student. I‚Äôm really excited to put myself forward for the role of webmaster for CSS.

# My motivation

<center><a href="https://bristollink.uk"><img class="link-logo" src="/images/projects/bristollink/logo.webp" width="20%"></a></center>

Earlier this year, I created an anonymous matchmaking platform called BristolLink for my fellow first-year CS students, which successfully gathered 50 users. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of building a website that connects CS students, and I would love to continue doing so as your webmaster next year.

As a current team lead for the Bristol Formula Student AI team üèéÔ∏è, I believe I can utilize my coding skills effectively to design and enhance the BrisHack and CSS webpages.

# My goal for the coming year

My goal is to boost student participation in our CS societies, given the CSS website is a major platform for advertising CS events. To increase student participation in CSS events, I plan to develop a multi-language website for BrisHack, making the event more accessible to international students who might otherwise hesitate due to language barriers. Participating in BrisHack this year was an incredible experience, and I want to help ensure that more students can take advantage of this opportunity to collaborate and grow.

# Final remarks

I would sincerely appreciate your support by casting your vote for me. I would also love to hear your feedback and opinions. Together, let‚Äôs make our CS community more connected and inclusive. Finally, I wish you all the very best on your final exams and thanks for considering me for webmaster. üòäüçÄ
